                <p>Have had a great fun life. So many great experiences I wouldn't trade any of it for the world. WOW!
                    The thing I love best about my lifes experiences are the people and friends I have made along the
                    way. I have great family and friends who I can call when Im in troubble. I have a my oldest friend
                    that I have known for over 35 years.</p>

                <p>My family, like all families has issues, but who doesn't have issues? I believe we are spiritual
                    beings who come here to have a human experience and RE-member who and what we really are. The more I
                    learn and discover the more I realize who little I know. Today I am easy on myself and life is easy.
                </p>
                <p>I feel so grateful to be healthy and fit. I have found the best solution and way to achieve such
                    great health and fitness is to do the opposite of what the medical system and main(lame) stream
                    media push out to the public. I frustrates me to know that there are doctors who have been murdered,
                    had their practices shutdown or have had to leave the country because they are healing people
                    naturally.</p>
